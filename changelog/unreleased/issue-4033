Change: copy command no longer prints skipped existing snapshots by default

Restic copy always printed each skipped snapshot that existed on the remote and
would bury the snapshots that were copied amongst the output.  The new default
only outputs new copies.  Increase the verbose level to see skipped existing
snapshots.
